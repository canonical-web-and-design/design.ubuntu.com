We have introduced two different dot patterns to give texture to your work.</p>
<p>We took inspiration from graph paper and engineering blue prints for the widely spaced developer dot pattern. When you see widely spaced patterns of dots, the content is more developer-oriented than user-oriented.</p>
<p>The enterprise dot pattern is a fine dot weave reminiscent of high precision engineering. When you see tightly spaced patterns of dots, the content is more enterprise-oriented than consumer-oriented.</p>
<p>You can use both dot patterns together, if both are appropriate for the work in question. The relative amount of either pattern is determined by the exact weightings for Enterprise and Developer on those sliders.</p>
<div class="box smaller"><strong>Use the dot patterns creatively</strong><br />
You can use a single row of dots as a boundary, or a small area of dots, or larger areas. You can make the dots part of the image you are creating, or part of the background.</div>

<h2>Two versions: dot size and spacing</h2>
<h3>Widely spaced dots: developer dot pattern</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-564" title="dot-types-wide" src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/70693f73-dot-types-wide.gif" alt="Widely spaced dots" width="227" height="262" /><br />
When communications are developer lead, or are aimed at the developer market, the widely spaced dots must be used.<br />
<strong>0.7mm dot, 6mm spacing</strong></p>
<hr class="clear" />
<h3>Tightly spaced dots: enterprise dot pattern</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-565" title="dot-types-tight" src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/3dd24a96-dot-types-tight.gif" alt="Tightly spaced dots" width="227" height="262" /><br />
When communications are enterprise lead, or are aimed at the enterprise market, the tightly spaced dots must be used.<br />
<strong>0.3mm dot, 1mm spacing</strong></p>
<div class="wp-link-top clearfix"><a href="#">top</a></div>
<h2>Large format use: dot size and spacing</h2>
<h3>Widely spaced dots</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-590" title="dots-large-wide" src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/98bfbd01-dots-large-wide.gif" alt="Dots for large format use: wide" width="217" height="323" srcset="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/98bfbd01-dots-large-wide.gif 217w, https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/ced54363-dots-large-wide-201x300.gif 201w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /><br />
When developer dots are required for large format print work, such as posters or banners, use this format.<br />
<strong>4mm dot, 36mm spacing</strong></p>
<hr class="clear" />
<h3>Tightly spaced dots</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-593" title="dots-large-tight" src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/98e9ebdd-dots-large-tight.gif" alt="Dots for large format use: tight" width="217" height="323" srcset="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/98e9ebdd-dots-large-tight.gif 217w, https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/2057b29e-dots-large-tight-201x300.gif 201w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /><br />
When enterprise dots are required for large format print work, such as posters or banners, use this format.<br />
<strong>2mm dot, 6mm spacing</strong></p>
<div class="wp-link-top clearfix"><a href="#">top</a></div>
